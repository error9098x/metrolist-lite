[![Fork of Metrolist](https://img.shields.io/badge/fork%20of-Metrolist-35D0BE)](https://github.com/MetrolistGroup/Metrolist)

A native **macOS desktop music player** for YouTube Music — search, play, synced
word‑by‑word lyrics, and offline downloads — in a clean dark, Apple‑Music‑style UI.

Metrolist Lite is a **fork of [Metrolist](https://github.com/MetrolistGroup/Metrolist)**
(an Android YouTube Music client). Metrolist focuses on Android; this fork adds a
cross‑platform‑friendly desktop app that **reuses Metrolist's pure‑Kotlin modules**
(`innertube`, `lrclib`, `betterlyrics`) for the heavy lifting.

> Status: personal‑use MVP for macOS. Works today; rough edges expected.

## Features

- 🔎 **Search** YouTube Music songs
- ▶️ **Playback** via `mpv` (+ `yt-dlp`) — keeps playing when the window is minimized
- 🎤 **Lyrics** — line‑synced (LRCLIB) and **word‑by‑word** karaoke (BetterLyrics/TTML),
  with a smooth pastel gradient sweep
- ⬇️ **Downloads** — save audio **and** lyrics + cover art for **offline** playback
- 🎚️ Queue, shuffle, repeat, seek, volume
- 🖼️ **Now Playing** with album‑art gradient background and a distraction‑free
  fullscreen "Zen" mode

## Install

**Easiest — download the `.dmg`** from [Releases](../../releases). It's **fully
self‑contained**: the app bundles its own Java runtime **plus `mpv` and `yt-dlp`**, so there's
nothing else to install. The app is unsigned, so on first launch use **right‑click → Open** to get
past Gatekeeper.

> Apple Silicon (arm64). Intel Macs aren't built yet.

## Run from source

For development you'll need JDK 21+ and `mpv` + `yt-dlp` on PATH:

```bash
brew install mpv yt-dlp
./gradlew :desktop-lite:run
```

Downloads are stored under `~/.metrolist-lite/downloads/` (audio + `.lyrics.json` +
cover), with an index that persists across restarts.

## Architecture

The desktop app lives in the **`desktop-lite/`** module — a pure Kotlin/JVM Swing
`application`. It does **not** depend on the Android library projects; instead it
compiles the reusable pure‑Kotlin sources directly:

| Reused module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `innertube` | YouTube Music search + player API |
| `lrclib` | LRCLIB line‑synced lyrics |
| `betterlyrics` | Word‑by‑word (TTML) lyrics |

Inside `desktop-lite/` the code is organized by responsibility (search, stream
resolution, playback, lyrics, downloads, UI) behind small interfaces. Playback is
delegated to the external `mpv` process; stream/lyrics resolution is offline‑first
for downloaded songs.

## Relationship to upstream Metrolist

This repository is a **fork** kept intentionally close to upstream so module fixes
(e.g. when YouTube changes) can be pulled in:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/MetrolistGroup/Metrolist
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main   # or cherry-pick module changes
```

The original Metrolist (Android) README is kept as
[`README.metrolist.md`](README.metrolist.md).

**Retained upstream files:** the Android app (`app/`), Fastlane, store assets and
other modules from Metrolist are kept in the tree for module reuse and to keep
upstream sync simple. They are not used by the desktop app and may be trimmed later.

## Releases

Tagged releases publish a self‑contained macOS `.dmg` (built with `jpackage` on a
macOS CI runner) under [Releases](../../releases). Push a tag like `v1.0.0` to trigger
the **Desktop Release (DMG)** workflow, or run it manually from the Actions tab.

Build a DMG locally (needs `mpv` + `dylibbundler` installed so they can be vendored):

```bash
brew install mpv dylibbundler
scripts/package-dmg.sh 1.1.0   # -> "build/dist/Metrolist Lite-1.1.0.dmg"
```

The DMG bundles a Java runtime **and** `mpv` (with its dylibs) **and** `yt-dlp`, so users need
nothing else installed. On first run the app clears the Gatekeeper quarantine on its bundled
binaries automatically; the `.app` itself is unsigned, so right‑click → Open the first time.

`innertube` / `lrclib` / `betterlyrics` modules and the original project goes to the
